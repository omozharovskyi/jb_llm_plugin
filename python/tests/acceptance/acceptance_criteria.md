# Acceptance Criteria for LLM VM Manager (MVP Implementation)

This document outlines the business requirements and acceptance criteria for the LLM VM Manager application, which is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation of the JetBrains Plugin for On-Demand Cloud-Based LLM Integration project. These criteria define what the application must do to be considered complete and ready for production use.

## Overview

LLM VM Manager is a command-line tool for managing Google Cloud Platform virtual machines for running Large Language Models (LLMs) with Ollama. The application automates the process of creating, managing, and using GPU-accelerated VMs for LLM inference.

- The application MUST support creating VMs with GPU acceleration.
- The application MUST configure the VM with the necessary firewall rules.
- The application MUST prevent creating a VM with a name that already exists.
- The application SHOULD provide clear feedback during the VM creation process.

#### 1.2 VM Operations
- The application MUST be able to start an existing VM instance.
- The application MUST be able to stop a running VM instance.
- The application MUST be able to delete a VM instance.
- The application MUST be able to list all VM instances.
- The application MUST verify that a VM exists before attempting to start, stop, or delete it.
- The application SHOULD provide clear feedback during VM operations.

### 2. Ollama Integration

#### 2.1 Ollama Setup
- The application MUST install and configure Ollama on the VM during creation.
- The application MUST set up Ollama to be accessible via its API.
- The application MUST configure Ollama to start automatically when the VM starts.
- The application SHOULD provide clear feedback during the Ollama setup process.

#### 2.2 LLM Model Management
- The application MUST support pulling a specified LLM model to Ollama.
- The application MUST support using a default model specified in the configuration.
- The application MUST verify that the model is available after pulling it.
- The application SHOULD provide clear feedback during the model pulling process.

### 3. Security

#### 3.1 Authentication and Authorization
- The application MUST use secure authentication with Google Cloud Platform.
- The application MUST use SSH keys for secure connection to VMs.
- The application MUST store sensitive information (like SSH keys and GCP credentials) securely.
- The application SHOULD NOT expose sensitive information in logs or output.

#### 3.2 Network Security
- The application MUST set up firewall rules to restrict access to the Ollama API.
- The application MUST allow access to the Ollama API only from the user's IP address.
- The application SHOULD provide a way to update firewall rules if the user's IP address changes.

### 4. Configuration and Usability

#### 4.1 Configuration
- The application MUST support configuration via a TOML file.
- The application MUST validate the configuration and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.
- The application MUST support command-line arguments to override configuration values.
- The application SHOULD provide sensible defaults for configuration values.

#### 4.2 Usability
- The application MUST provide clear help information via the --help flag.
- The application MUST provide version information via the --version flag.
- The application MUST provide clear error messages for all error conditions.
- The application SHOULD provide verbose logging when requested.
- The application SHOULD be easy to install and set up.

### 5. Error Handling and Reliability

#### 5.1 Error Handling
- The application MUST handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.
- The application MUST handle network failures gracefully.
- The application MUST handle GCP API failures gracefully.
- The application MUST handle SSH connection failures gracefully.
- The application SHOULD provide suggestions for resolving common errors.

#### 5.2 Reliability
- The application MUST be reliable and stable during normal operation.
- The application MUST not leave resources in an inconsistent state after failures.
- The application SHOULD implement retries for transient failures.
- The application SHOULD implement timeouts for operations that might hang.

## Future Business Requirements

### 6. Multi-VM Management

#### 6.1 Multiple VM Support
- The application SHOULD support managing multiple VMs with different configurations.
- The application SHOULD support creating multiple VMs in a single command.
- The application SHOULD support starting, stopping, and deleting multiple VMs in a single command.
- The application SHOULD provide a way to group and manage related VMs.

### 7. Cost Management

#### 7.1 Cost Estimation
- The application SHOULD provide an estimate of the cost of running a VM.
- The application SHOULD provide an estimate of the cost of running a VM for a specified period.
- The application SHOULD provide an estimate of the cost of running multiple VMs.

#### 7.2 Cost Optimization
- The application SHOULD provide recommendations for cost optimization.
- The application SHOULD support automatically stopping VMs when they are not in use.
- The application SHOULD support scheduling VM operations to minimize costs.

### 8. Performance Monitoring

#### 8.1 VM Performance
- The application SHOULD provide information about VM performance.
- The application SHOULD provide information about GPU utilization.
- The application SHOULD provide information about memory and CPU usage.

#### 8.2 LLM Performance
- The application SHOULD provide information about LLM inference performance.
- The application SHOULD provide information about model loading times.
- The application SHOULD provide information about inference latency and throughput.

### 9. Multi-Cloud Support

#### 9.1 AWS Integration
- The application SHOULD support creating and managing VMs on AWS.
- The application SHOULD support installing and configuring Ollama on AWS VMs.
- The application SHOULD support pulling LLM models to Ollama on AWS VMs.

#### 9.2 Azure Integration
- The application SHOULD support creating and managing VMs on Azure.
- The application SHOULD support installing and configuring Ollama on Azure VMs.
- The application SHOULD support pulling LLM models to Ollama on Azure VMs.

### 10. User Interface

#### 10.1 Web Interface
- The application SHOULD provide a web interface for managing VMs and LLM models.
- The application SHOULD provide a dashboard with information about VMs and LLM models.
- The application SHOULD support user authentication and authorization for the web interface.

#### 10.2 API
- The application SHOULD provide a REST API for programmatic access.
- The application SHOULD provide API documentation.
- The application SHOULD support API authentication and authorization.

## Acceptance Criteria

The LLM VM Manager application will be considered ready for production use when:

1. All core business requirements are met.
2. All acceptance tests defined in the acceptance testing plan pass.
3. The application is stable and reliable in real-world usage scenarios.
4. The application provides a good user experience with clear feedback and error messages.
5. The application is well-documented with installation, configuration, and usage instructions.

Future business requirements will be evaluated and prioritized for implementation in future releases.
